                        Trackgenix was created remotely in 2008 by Yves Hiernaux and Mic Cvilic after many years of 
                        working with hard-to-manage and even harder-to-understand reports and timesheets. Although we 
                        have grown, we continue with the same goal of offering a flexible, reliable and easy-to-use 
                        time control tool.
